<h1>Get Started with RockTCHA now!</h1>
<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>It Works!</b> Fans listen to a short clip and then type in the song name to submit the web form</li>
  <li><b>It's Free!</b> Yup.</li>
  <li><b>It's Useful</b> Why let anyone through who doesn't know the titles to your songs?</li>
  <li><b>It's Secure</b> Seriously if they don't know the name your songs, they won't get through </li>
  <li><b>It's Easy</b> If they are a fan of yours. And if they're not? Screw them!! They aren't getting through.</li>
  <li><b>It's Less Annoying</b> Than a CAPTCHA or one of those new ads that ticketmaster now uses so they can annoy you and get paid</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Send a request to http://rocktcha.herokuapp.com/challenge/anyUniqueSessionHere.<br />
    If using in your web form, embed an iframe. Or you can just use the url structure to pass in params: /challenge/unique_session and /answer/unique_session/the_answer
  </li>
  <li>Using the same unique session id as above as a url parameter, send your users' response to http://rocktcha.herokuapp.com/answer/theSameUniqueSessionHere/usersAnswer via get or post
    <p>Here's an example form, also available at /example: </p>
    <xmp>
      <form action="//rocktcha.herokuapp.com/answer/anyUniqueSessionHere/" method="post" accept-charset="utf-8">
        <label for="song">Enter the name of the song to defeat the RockTCHA</label>
        <br />
        <iframe src="//rocktcha.herokuapp.com/challenge/anyUniqueSessionHere" width=90 height=110 seamless='seamless'></iframe>
        <br />
        <br />
        <input type="text" name="answer" id="" value="" />
        <input type="submit" name="submit" id="" value="Submit Answer" />
      
      </form>
    </xmp>
  
  </li>

  <li>Parse the response! If the user knows the track name, a correct response is given, 1. If not, it's incorrect, 0.</li>
  <li>Finally only let in users who ROCK!</li>
</ul>
